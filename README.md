# gdlookup

A (personal) utility to assist in grabbing important Grateful Dead related information. For exmaple, where did a specific show took place.

It is released in the hope that it will be valuable to someone and for backup purposes. I do hope it will not greatly embarrass me in the future in horrible unforeseen ways.

## Usage
```gdlookup -d=DATE``` where DATE is of the format ```YY-MM-DD```.
```gdlookup -f=FILE``` for scanning an input file with show dates on each line
A verbose flag, ```-v```, can also be added.
